# Development Log: Photo Editor MVP Rebuild

## Initial Plan

### Problem Statement
- Current photo editor application needs rebuilding with better architecture
- Need to establish clean testing practices from the start
- Want to follow TDD approach for reliable development
- Focus on maintainable, well-documented code

### Objectives
- [ ] Set up new project structure with testing framework
- [ ] Create basic window with image display capability
- [ ] Implement file selection functionality
- [ ] Add grayscale conversion operation
- [ ] Implement basic save functionality

### Technical Requirements
- PySide6 for GUI framework
- OpenCV for image processing
- pytest with pytest-qt for testing
- Clean architecture with separation of concerns
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Documentation for all components

### Dependencies
- PySide6
- OpenCV (cv2)
- pytest
- pytest-qt
- Virtual environment setup
- Git repository initialization

### Learning Goals
- Understanding PySide6 architecture and signals
- Image processing fundamentals with OpenCV
- Test-driven development practices
- Clean code organization and documentation

## Session Summaries

### Session 1 - 11/10/2024
#### Status
- Start Time: 12 pm
- End Time: 4 pm
- Developer: Col & AI Assistant
- Location: feature/mvp-rebuild branch

#### Progress
- Initialized new project structure
- Set up virtual environment
- Installed required dependencies
- Created basic file structure
- Added .gitignore configuration
- Started test framework setup

#### Technical Notes
- Project structure follows modern Python practices
- Testing infrastructure uses pytest with pytest-qt
- Basic window implementation started with test-first approach
- File organization supports clean architecture principles

#### Challenges
- Need to establish consistent test patterns
- Must define clear boundaries between components
- Documentation standards need refinement

#### Next Steps
- [X] Complete MainWindow test cases
- [ ] Implement basic window with image display
- [ ] Document component interfaces
- [ ] Create test documentation

### Session 2 - 11/11/2024
#### Status
- Start Time: 11 am
- End Time: 12 PM
- Developer: User & AI Assistant
- Location: feature/mvp-rebuild branch

#### Progress
- Established new development log format
- Converted existing documentation
- Ready to proceed with implementation

#### Technical Notes
- New issue-oriented logging system established
- Documentation structure improved
- Development workflow refined

#### Next Steps
- [X] Review and enhance existing test cases
- [ ] Begin TDD cycle for MainWindow implementation
- [ ] Document component interfaces
- [ ] Create test documentation

#### Progress
- Enhanced development logging system:
  - Converted to issue-oriented format
  - Added session tracking
  - Improved documentation structure
- Initiated learning documentation system:
  - Created basic documentation structure
  - Implemented optimized templates
  - Set up metadata tracking
  - Established learning paths framework
- Created comprehensive issue for documentation system development
- Paused MVP development for infrastructure improvements

#### Technical Notes
- Developed Python script for documentation management
- Implemented metadata tracking system
- Created Mermaid-based visualization templates
- Established progressive disclosure documentation pattern

#### Challenges
- Balancing MVP development with infrastructure improvements
- Ensuring documentation system remains maintainable
- Integrating learning documentation with development workflow

#### Next Steps
- [ ] Return to MVP development
  - Review existing test cases
  - Complete MainWindow implementation
  - Document components as we build
- [ ] Create GitHub issue for documentation system
- [ ] Plan documentation system development timeline
